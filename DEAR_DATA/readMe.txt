Hi , I'm Daniel, and this is my Processing file for Dear Data.
It documents the locations I visited during my week of data collection. These locations are represented by circles, and are colour coded depending on what the location is, and when the mouse hovers over one of these circles it shows the name of the location. This location and weekday data is held in a CSV file database , and it pulls it from that database into this file. There is no data showing for Sunday as I did not do anything Sunday.





Alongside these locations, I have chosen a "Song of the Day", this being a song I remember listening to the most on that day, or the one which stuck out to me the most from that day. These can be viewed by clicking on  the day of the week, with it containing a hyperlink to the song. Although , yes , this is technically a separate piece of data being recorded, I just wanted to give an insight as to who I am as a person and my interests to try and personalise it a bit more.





Admittedly the idea for the data I've collected here and the song inclusions were drawn from Week 2 and 41 from the Dear Data book, but I felt that the addition of what music I was listening to fit the theme, as I often listen to music whilst travelling.


This program is essentially held together by duct tape and string. There was more I wanted to do, such as fixing the issue of the weekday text shifting position and changing its size when this "Read Me" is opened, however I do not have the time to do so, and so in the spirit of "Creative Coding" I will simply label it a creative design decision and move on. 



I hope  you enjoy viewing my data,
Daniel
